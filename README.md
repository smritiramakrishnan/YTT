<h1> Yoga Teacher</h1>
<h2> Yoga Teacher Training</h2>
I spent over 150 hours in classes learning about different facets of yoga such as poses and asanas, meditation, breathing exercises, ayurveda, and other yoga concepts. I then spent more than 120 hours shadowing yoga teachers and teaching yoga classes in order to gain my certification. I also wrote a 25 page field report researching how yoga is used in weight loss medicine. I used the knowledge I gained shadowing a weight loss doctor to add to my field report.

<h2> Teaching </h2>
I have spent more than 100 hours teaching a wide variety of students ranging from children to adults.
